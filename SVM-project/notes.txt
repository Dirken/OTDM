Implement the primal and dual quadratic formulation of the support vector machine in AMPL.
Apply to a dataset obtained with the accompanying generator (both linux and windows executables). Validate the SVM with data different from that of the training set.
Optionally (but highly recommended for a good mark) you can apply it to other datasets.
Compute the separation hyperplane from the dual model and check that it coincides with that of the primal model.
The report must include all the previous elements (AMPL code, results obtained, analysis of results, etc).
This assignment is to be done in groups of two students.
(Note: If you are using Windows, check that your Windows installation has Microsoft Visual Studio runtime libraries, otherwise you may have problems running gensvmdat.exe. If you experience such a problems, I recommed you to generate the data file with the Linux version (gensvmdat) in a Linux box, and then to copy the resulting file to Windows)
